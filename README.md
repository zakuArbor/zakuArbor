**Hello World**
Welcome to my Github Page. I am a "software developer" on paper but I like to refer to myself as a DevOps developer due to the nature of my job.

I aspire to work in Systems in the near future and work on software that takes into consideration of both hardware and software to make awesome products.

Although I have a lot of side projects in web development, I'll be focusing more towards working on side projets related to Systems or embedded programming as that is more of my current interest.
